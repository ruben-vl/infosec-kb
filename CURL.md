# Client URL

Command-line tool that supports HTTP along with many other protocols.

## Basic GET request

```bash
curl inlanefreight.com
```

## Download Response

Flag `-O` can be used to download the response with the remote file name. Flag `-o` can be used to download it and specify the file name.

## Silent

Flag `-s` can be used to silence the printing of status messages from cURL.

## Skip Certificate Check

Flag `-k` can be used to skip the certificate check. Only use this for testing a local web application or for practice purposes.

## Verbose

Flag `-v` can be used to print both the request and response. The `-vvv` flag shows even more verbose output.
